# Recipe App (React Frontend)

This project is a React frontend for a recipe application.  It allows users to create, view, and manage recipes.  The frontend communicates with a PHP backend API to handle data persistence.

## Features

* **Create Recipe:** Users can create new recipes by providing a title, ingredients, instructions, and author. Client-side validation ensures all required fields are completed.  A loading spinner provides feedback during submission, and error messages are displayed if there are issues.
* **View Recipes (Planned):**  Future functionality will allow users to view a list of recipes, with features like pagination and searching.
* **Recipe Details (Planned):** Users will be able to view the full details of a specific recipe.
* **Edit/Delete Recipes (Planned):** Users will have the ability to edit or delete their own recipes.


## Technologies Used

* **React:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* **React Router:** For navigation and routing within the application.
* **Axios:**  Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
* **Bootstrap:** CSS framework for styling.
* **PHP (Backend):** Server-side language for the API.
* **MySQL (Backend):** Database for storing recipe data.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd recipe-app
3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install

4. Run the development server:

## Future Development

* View Recipes: Implement the functionality to display a list of recipes fetched from the backend API. This will include pagination to handle large datasets and a search feature to filter recipes.
  
* Recipe Details: Create a page to display the full details of a selected recipe, including ingredients, instructions, and author.
  
* Edit/Delete Recipes: Add functionality for users to edit and delete existing recipes. This will require user authentication and authorization to ensure users can only modify their own recipes.

* User Authentication: Implement user authentication to allow users to create accounts and manage their recipes.
Enhanced Styling: Improve the overall styling and user interface of the application.
